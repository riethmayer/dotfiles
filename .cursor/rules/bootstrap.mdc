# Bootstrap Script Organization
- All bootstrap scripts must be in `stow/bootstrap/.system-bootstrap.d/`
- Scripts must be numbered with three digits (e.g., `001_`, `002_`)
- Each script should focus on a single tool or component
- Scripts must be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Use consistent error handling and logging

# Brewfile Management
- Split Brewfiles by purpose in `stow/bootstrap/.brewfile.d/`
- Main Brewfile should only include essential tools
- Tool-specific Brewfiles should be named after their purpose
- Use consistent formatting and grouping in Brewfiles
- Document any special installation requirements

# Script Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with underscores for script names
- Prefix scripts with their purpose (e.g., `setup_`, `install_`)
- Use consistent file extensions (.sh for shell scripts)
- Group related scripts in appropriate subdirectories
- Keep script names descriptive but concise

# Configuration File Structure
- Follow XDG Base Directory Specification
- Use consistent file naming across tools
- Group related configurations in subdirectories
- Document any non-standard configurations
- Keep configurations modular and focused

# Tool-specific Setup Patterns
- Each tool should have its own setup script
- Follow consistent pattern for tool installation
- Include version management where applicable
- Document any tool-specific requirements
- Handle dependencies explicitly

# Best Practices
- Use consistent error handling across scripts
- Include helpful error messages
- Log important operations
- Check for prerequisites
- Clean up temporary files
- Use environment variables for paths
